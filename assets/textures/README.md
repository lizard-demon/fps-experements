# Textures

This directory contains the game's texture files.

## Directory Structure

- `png/` - Source PNG files (create your textures here)
- `*.rgba` - Converted RGBA files (generated by the conversion script)

## Quick Start

1. **Create PNG textures** in the `png/` directory
2. **Convert them**: `./tools/formatting/textures.sh`
3. **Use in code**: Reference by filename (without extension)

```zig
// Use texture named "grass.rgba"
renderer.addBrush(brush, color, "grass");
```

## Workflow

1. Create or place PNG files in the `png/` directory
2. Run the conversion script: `./tools/formatting/textures.sh`
3. The script will convert all PNG files to RGBA format
4. The game will automatically load and pack them into a texture atlas

## Supported Sizes

The texture loader supports square textures with these dimensions:
- 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024

## Current Status

- ✅ `test.rgba` - Currently loaded and used by all geometry
- 🔄 Add more textures by placing PNG files in `png/` and running the conversion script

## Notes

- Textures are automatically packed into an atlas for optimal performance
- Reference textures by filename (without extension) in the code
- The game requires at least one texture file to run
